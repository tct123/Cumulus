  <h3 align="center">XCVario pairing</h3>
  
  Cumulus can be paired via different interfaces with an XCVario device. 
  Usually the interfaces Bluetooth or WiFi are used for this purpose. How to
  setup such a pairing, look into the user guide of the
  <a href="https://xcvario.com/docs-category/vario/">XCVario</a> devive.
  
  <h3> XCVario pairing via Bluetooth</h3>
  
  You can connect Cumulus via Bluetooth to an XCVario and exchange data via the
  serial interface S1 of the XCVario device. Usually you will connect a Flarm
  device at this serial interface. For usage you have to pair Cumulus with
  the XCVario device. In the XCVario device you have to activate the routing
  of S1 via Bluetooth.
  
  <h3>XCVario pairing via WiFi</h3>
  
  Via the WiFi interface you can establish a connection to an XCVario device
  and exchange data via the interfaces S1, S2 and the internal data channel of
  the XCVario. There are three Tcp ports available under the IP address 
  <b>192.168.4.1</b>. A WiFi connection must be established from Cumulus to the
  XCVario device, where the XCVario devive is working as a WiFi server. The
  WiFi access point uses the name <b>XCVario-[nnnn]</b>. The related password
  is <b>xcvario-21</b>.
  <p>
  <b>Note:</b> These connections will only work properly, if the interfaces
  WLAN, BT, S1, S2 and the routing are setup correctly in the XCVario device.
  Have a look into the user guide of the
  <a href="https://xcvario.com/docs-category/vario/">XCVario</a> device.
